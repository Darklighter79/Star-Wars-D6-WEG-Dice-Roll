# Star-Wars-D6-WEG-Dice-Roll
This is my program of dice rolling Star Wars RPG West End Games setting. 
You provide the dice pool and difficulty level to be beaten. Program gives you info about each roll and adds the results. 
Then it is compared with difficulty number.

Wild Die rule is included:
a) 6 on Wild Die provides with additional roll. If another 6 is rolled, it keeps rolling. All is summed and added at the end.
b) 1 on Wild Die removes "1" and highest Die value from the total.

I have also added info about Advantage / Disadvantage to the WildDie - from Zorro d6 rules - so GMs will get clear info for additional description 
of the action outcome / or can incorporate the rules straight from Zorro D6.

I use the following variant: for each "6" on a Wild Die, a hero gets CP point that can be used for boosting rolls only.
